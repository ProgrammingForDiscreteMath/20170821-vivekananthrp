1. Where are the triangular numbers?

2. Please do not remove docstrings from function definitions.

3. Obviously you were not expected to use Sage here - but I let you off this time ;)

4. Strange use of ``L`` in ten primes. This is not good coding practice; shoud use ``for i in range(10)`` (-1 point)
